# Fabrico Startup IAC Bundle

This repository contains the Terraform code to create the infrastructure for a Fabrico Startup stack. The code is organized into modules that can be used to create the infrastructure for different Cloud Providers. The following Cloud Providers are supported:

* AWS
* GCP (Coming soon)
* Azure (Coming soon)

This repository only has the modules and is not supposed to be executed directly. Instead, you should create a new repository for for your infrastructure, with the required specification in terragrunt and excute from that repository. We provide a template repository that you can use to get started (TBD: Link to template repository).

The instructions to create a new repository and execute the code are provided in the [Fabrico Startup IAC Bundle]() TBD: Link to Fabrico Startup IAC Bundle template repository.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following tools installed to utilize this codebase.

TBD: (Add installation instructions for the following tools)

* Terraform
* Terragrunt
* kubectl
* Helm
* AWS CLI
* AWS IAM Authenticator
